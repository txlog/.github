# Security Policy

We take the security of the Package Transaction Log project seriously. If you
believe you have discovered a security vulnerability, we ask that you follow the
guidelines below for responsible disclosure.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

1. **Please do not publicly disclose the vulnerability.** Instead, report it
   privately to the project maintainers [via email](sec@rda.run).

2. **Provide details.** In your report, please include the following
   information:
    * Description of the vulnerability, including the potential impact.
    * Affected versions of Package Transaction Log.
    * Steps to reproduce the vulnerability (if possible).
    * Any proof-of-concept code you may have.

3. **Encryption:** If possible, please encrypt your report using our PGP key.
   You can find it
   [here](https://rda.run/gpg/Rodrigo-de-Avila_0x3A860313_public.asc).

## Response Procedure

* **Acknowledgement:** We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report
  as soon as possible.
* **Investigation and Fix:** We will investigate the issue and work on
  developing a fix.
* **Release:**  A patched version will be released as soon as possible, along
  with a security advisory detailing the vulnerability and mitigation steps.
* **Credit:**  We will give appropriate credit to the reporter in the security
  advisory, unless you wish to remain anonymous.

## Our Commitment

We are committed to addressing security vulnerabilities promptly and
responsibly. We appreciate your cooperation in helping us protect the Package
Transaction Log project and its users.

## Additional Notes

* We kindly request that you refrain from automated vulnerability scanning tools
  on the live deployment of the project (if applicable). These can create
  excessive load and potentially disrupt the project.
* This security policy may be revised over time as needed.

**Thank you for your help in keeping the Package Transaction Log project
secure!**
