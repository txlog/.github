# Contributing to Transaction Log

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Transaction Log
project! Your contributions are a valuable asset in making this a helpful
resource for the open-source community.

## Types of Contributions

Here are a few different ways you can contribute:

* **Reporting Updates:**  If you notice an RPM package update that is missing
  from the history, please submit the details in a new issue.
* **Expanding Data:** Consider adding new data fields if you think they'd
  enhance the project's usefulness (e.g., CVE references, package maintainer
  information).
* **Improving Documentation:** Help us improve the clarity of our README or
  other project documentation.
* **Code Enhancements:** If you have ideas for making the code better, more
  efficient, or adding features, please submit your proposals.

## How to Contribute

1. **Discuss Before Major Changes:** If you plan on making a substantial change,
   please open an issue first to outline your idea and gather feedback. This
   helps prevent wasted effort and ensures your contribution aligns with the
   project's direction.

2. **Create an Issue:** If you've found a missing update, want to suggest a new
   feature, or have found a bug, please create a new issue in the repository.
   Use clear and descriptive titles.

3. **Fork the Repository:** Fork the desired 'Transaction Log' repository into
   your own GitHub account.

4. **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch based off the `main` branch. Give
   your branch a meaningful name that reflects the changes you intend to make
   (e.g., `update-package-xyz`, `add-cve-field`).

5. **Make your Changes:** Make your changes to the code or documentation in your
   branch. Be sure to follow any existing code style guidelines.

6. **Test:** If you've added code, be sure to write tests to ensure your changes
   work as intended and don't break any existing functionality.

7. **Submit a Pull Request:** Once you are satisfied with your changes, open a
   pull request (PR) against the original 'Transaction Log' repository. Provide
   a clear description of your changes and why they are beneficial in the PR
   description.
